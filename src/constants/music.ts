        James Blunt - You're Beautiful (Video) Lyrics (.LRC)
[00:14.50]My life is brilliant
[00:26.00]My life is brilliant
[00:28.60]My love is pure
[00:31.70]I saw an angel
[00:34.60]Of that I'm sure
[00:36.70]She smiled at me on the subway
[00:39.70]She was with another man
[00:43.00]But I won't lose no sleep on that
[00:45.80]'Cause I've got a plan
[00:49.30]You're beautiful
[00:52.20]You're beautiful
[00:55.20]You're beautiful, it's true
[01:00.40]I saw your face in a crowded place
[01:07.80]And I don't know what to do
[01:13.40]'Cause I'll never be with you
[01:27.60]Yes, she caught my eye
[01:31.20]As we walked on by
[01:34.10]She could see from my face that I was,
[01:38.00]******' high
[01:39.50]And I don't think that I'll see her again
[01:45.20]But we shared a moment that will last till the end
[01:52.20]You're beautiful
[01:55.10]You're beautiful
[01:58.00]You're beautiful, it's true
[02:03.40]I saw your face in a crowded place
[02:10.80]And I don't know what to do
[02:16.40]'Cause I'll never be with you
[02:34.90]You're beautiful
[02:37.60]You're beautiful
[02:40.40]You're beautiful, it's true
[02:45.90]There must be an angel with a smile on her face
[02:53.00]When she thought up that I should be with you
[03:03.20]But it's time to face the truth
[03:08.90]I will never be with you`

[00:00.00]Music
[00:39.60]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[00:43.60]All of my change, I've spent on you
[00:47.90]Where have the times gone?
[00:50.30]Baby, it's all wrong
[00:52.30]Where are the plans we made for two?
[00:57.20]Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
[01:00.00]The people we used to be.
[01:02.50]it's even harder to picture
[01:04.80]That you're not here next to me
[01:06.90]You say it's too late to make it
[01:09.10]But is it too late to try?
[01:11.30]And in our time that you wasted
[01:13.20]All of our bridges burned down
[01:16.10]I've wasted my nights
[01:17.60]You turned out the lights
[01:20.00]Now I'm paralyzed
[01:22.40]Still stuck in that time when we called it love
[01:26.60]But even the sun sets in paradise.
[01:31.80]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[01:36.00]All of my change, I've spent on you
[01:40.10]Where have the times gone?
[01:42.40]Baby, it's all wrong
[01:44.60]Where are the plans we made for two?
[01:49.00]If happy ever after did exist
[01:53.20]I would still be holding you like this
[01:57.60]All those fairy tales are full of ****
[02:02.00]One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
[02:08.50]You turned your back on tomorrow
[02:10.20]'Cause you forgot yesterday
[02:12.10]I gave you my love to borrow
[02:14.60]But you just gave it away
[02:16.80]You can't expect me to be fine
[02:19.00]I don't expect you to care
[02:21.10]I know I said it before
[02:22.70]But all of our bridges burned down
[02:25.90]I've wasted my nights
[02:27.70]You turned out the lights
[02:29.90]Now I'm paralyzed
[02:32.00]Still stuck in that time when we called it love
[02:36.40]But even the sun sets in paradise.
[02:41.80]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[02:45.60]All of my change, I spent on you
[02:50.00]Where have the times gone
[02:52.20]Baby, it's all wrong
[02:54.40]Where are the plans we made for two?
[02:58.70]If happy ever after did exist
[03:03.00]I would still be holding you like this
[03:07.40]All those fairy tales are full of ****
[03:11.70]One more stupid love song I'll be sick
[03:15.80]Now I'm at a payphone.
[03:18.80]Man, **** that ****
[03:19.80]I'll be out spending all this money
[03:21.00]While you're sitting 'round wondering
[03:22.10]Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
[03:23.80]Made it from the bottom
[03:24.80]Now when you see me I'm stuntin'
[03:25.80]And all cars start with the push of a ****on
[03:28.20]Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
[03:30.60]Switch the number to my phone so you never could call it
[03:32.70]Don't need my name on my show, you can tell it I'm ballin
[03:34.90]Swish, what a shame, could have got picked
[03:37.20]Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
[03:39.40]So you talk about who you see at the top
[03:41.20]Or what you could have saw
[03:42.20]But sad to say it's over for
[03:43.50]Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
[03:45.80]Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
[03:48.00]Now it's me who they want
[03:49.40]So you can go and take that little piece of **** with you
[03:51.30]I'm at a payphone trying to call home
[03:55.50]All of my change, I spent on you
[03:59.60]Where have the times gone
[04:02.00]Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
[04:08.40]If happy ever after did exist
[04:12.90]I would still be holding you like this
[04:17.20]And all these fairy tales are full of ****
[04:21.40]Yeah, one more stupid love song, I'll be sick
[04:25.70]Now I'm at a payphone.

        [00:00.95]Music
        [00:11.70]I walk a lonely road
        [00:14.20]The only one that I have ever known
        [00:17.96]Don't know where it goes
        [00:19.95]But it's home to me, and I walk alone
        [00:28.70]I walk this empty street
        [00:31.46]On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
        [00:34.96]Where the city sleeps
        [00:36.95]And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
        [00:42.96]I walk alone, I walk alone
        [00:48.96]I walk alone, I walk a-
        [00:51.97]My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
        [00:57.70]My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
        [01:03.46]Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
        [01:09.20]Till then I walk alone
        [01:14.96]Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
        [01:20.96]Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
        [01:26.21]I'm walking down the line
        [01:28.70]That divides me somewhere in my mind
        [01:32.46]On the borderline
        [01:34.46]Of the edge, and where I walk alone
        [01:43.45]Read between the lines
        [01:46.20]What's fucked up, and everything's alright
        [01:49.70]Check my vital signs
        [01:51.95]To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
        [01:57.95]I walk alone, I walk alone
        [02:03.70]I walk alone, I walk a-
